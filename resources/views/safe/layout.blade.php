                        or legal entity that has applied to open a trading account at the Company’s CFD’s Trading platform
                        (the “Client”),according to the terms and conditions detailed herein. </span>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <span style="font-weight: 400;"> Introduction</span>
                </li>
            </ol>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.1 This agreement, as well as any legally binding document entered into between the Company and the
                        Client, all as amended from time to time (together: the “Agreement”), set out the terms upon which
                        the Company will deal with the Client in respect to placing orders and trading over financial instruments,
                        on the Company’s trading platform.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.2 Trading, means that a contract is being created which gives the Client the right to estimate the
                        direction of change in price of an underlying asset, within a specified time frame determined by
                        the Company. This trading instrument is different from trading in traditional options, since there
                        is a fixed return that is determined at the outset of the trade, there is usually no Stop-Loss order
                        and other features.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.3 Opening an account and usage of the Trading Platform provided by the Company is by limited license
                        given by the Company to the Client. The license is personal, non-transferable and is for persons
                        who are older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law applicable to the Client’s jurisdictions
                        requires a higher legal age) and subject to this Agreement. The Client may not transfer, assign,
                        or enable other to make any use of the license, and/or give the Clients access codes to the Trading
                        Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third party due to breach
                        of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client’s sole responsibility.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">1.4 All services are provided to the client by, which is the management company and the client enters
                        into a contractual agreement with only.</span>

            </ol>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.1 The Company will open an account for the Client (the “Trading Account”) as soon as reasonably practicable
                        after: (i) the Company has received confirmation that the Client has agreed to enter into this Agreement
                        (such confirmation can be made by checking the “I AGREE” button or link on the Company’s Internet
                        website (the “Website”), followed by a completed application form (if applicable) and all other Client’s
                        information required by the Company to be provided for full verification. The Client confirms that
                        Client’s information is full, accurate and complete. If there is a change in the information provided
                        by the Client at any time, the Client must notify the Company immediately of any such change.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.2 The Trading Account will be activated by the Company as soon as the Company has identified the funds
                        credited by the Client to the Trading Account. The Company may activate the Trading Account and permit
                        trading in the Trading Account subject to such limitations, and before full verification has been
                        determined, and to the satisfaction of such further requirements as the Company may impose. In the
                        event that the Trading Account is activated but any such requirements are not complied with, the
                        Company may freeze activity in the Trading Account. Where a Trading Account is not activated or is
                        frozen, no funds held by the Company in respect of that Trading Account may be transferred back or
                        to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied
                        with.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.3 In relation to any Transaction entered into pursuant to the Agreement the Company may act, according
                        to the Company’s sole discretion, as principal or as agent on the Client’s behalf. Therefore the
                        Company may act as the counter party to the Clients Trading activity. The Client confirms that it
                        acts as principal and not as agent or trustee on behalf of someone else.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">2.4 The Client hereby represents and warrants that his engagement with the Company in this Agreement
                        and his use of the Company’s services are in full compliance with the law applicable to the Client.</span>
