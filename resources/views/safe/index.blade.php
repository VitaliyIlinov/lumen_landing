                        or legal entity that has applied to open a trading account at the Company’s CFD’s Trading platform
                        (the “Client”),according to the terms and conditions detailed herein. </span>

                        the Company will deal with the Client in respect to placing orders and trading over financial instruments,

                        the Company. This trading instrument is different from trading in traditional options, since there
                        is a fixed return that is determined at the outset of the trade, there is usually no Stop-Loss order
                        and other features.</span>

                        who are older than 18 years old (or older legal age, if the law applicable to the Client’s jurisdictions
                        requires a higher legal age) and subject to this Agreement. The Client may not transfer, assign,
                        or enable other to make any use of the license, and/or give the Clients access codes to the Trading
                        Account to anyone. Any damage caused to the Client, the Company and any third party due to breach
                        of this Agreement by Client, shall be under the Client’s sole responsibility.</span>

                        to any other person until the Company is satisfied that all Applicable Regulations have been complied

                        markets formulas. It is acknowledged by both Parties that due to different calculation methods and
                        other circumstances, different trading platforms and/or markets may display different price quotes.</span>

            <span style="font-weight: 400;">You must be sure that you are able to confirm your identity by the provision of documents
                                    as required. If you are unable to do so, this may prevent the activation of an account
                                    with. The requirements are</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">A colour copy of your valid government issued ID (eg. passport, driver’s license, ID card).</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">Colour copies of your credit cards/debit cards (both front and back sides, with first twelve

                                    and covered masked CVV on the back) used to make the deposit.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">A copy of a recent utility bill or bank statement with your name and address (no more than
                                    3 months old). </span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">All four corners of the documents must be clearly visible with no alterations to the documents.
                                    If the name does not appear on the card, we need to see official evidence that the card
                                    belongs to the client.</span>
            <span style="font-weight: 400;">If the card belongs to another person, the Cardholder must provide their ID and a utility
                                    bill before verification can be completed, and the Cardholder is responsible for signing
                                    the Card Authorisation Forms confirming a deposit has been made with the card used.</span>
